ToDos for porting to 1.8
------------------------
*minimize Oracle unit definition, she could not be anyhow recruited (infinity cost, zero movement, stone,...?)
*check lorin karen competition - it seems it doesn't work correctly
*rename scenaros according to mainline naming convention
*improve maps
*fix image paths
*do workarounds when an appropriate image misses (e.g. attack sprites)
   *attack end>60
*add graphics for units
*Battle of Barnon:
   *ensure Gawen death - bunch of 3level units from turn 10, unlimitid number of turns
   *Gawen could'n go far from the fortress
*Start_of_the_Quest:
   *ensure only once Gawen tell Lorin "mother"

# units speaking in his/her death event
# unknown scenarios referred to by id
# macro references in translatable strings

# missing whitespaces in message macro calls
# macro calls CHECKVER, ANOVER and CHECKGAWEN removed (the definitions for these can be found in ANO for Wesnoth 1.2)
# Aragwaithe Race.cfg fixed
# removed undefined ELVISH_RECRUIT (first appearance in ANO for Wesnoth 1.4)
 syncing recruit= and recruitment_pattern=
# e.g. "Orcish Archer (archer) doesn't match the recruitment pattern (fighter, fighter, healer, fighter) for its side"
# e.g. "no healer units recruitable at difficulty NORMAL"
… *lots* of changes
… But more investigation is needed:
What was the original intention and what is best for balancing? Fix recruit= or recruitment_pattern= or both?

- bugfixes to recruit=
# renamed
Saurian Tribalist -> Saurian Augur
Saurian Icecaster -> Saurian Oracle
Human Ranger -> Ranger,Huntsman (a Human Ranger has a strong attack in melee *and* ranged (with marksman) combat)
# removed

Aragwaith Hunter - (to be found in ANO for Wesnoth 1.2)

- unit definitions

# missing unit
Shadow_Mage <- Shadow Mage copied from Liberty
